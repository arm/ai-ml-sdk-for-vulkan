Welcome to the '|SDK_project|' documentation
============================================

The '|SDK_project|' is a collection of libraries and tools to assist with the
integration and deployment of ML use cases via the Vulkan速 API. The SDK makes use
of new Arm速 Vulkan速 ML extensions which provide a hardware abstraction to enable
deployment of ML workloads that are both portable and acceleratable.

The tight integration of ML workloads into the rendering pipeline enables graphics
use-cases at improved levels of performance and efficiency and by leveraging the
TOSA 1.x specification, you can expect consistent behavior accross multiple vendor
implementations.
