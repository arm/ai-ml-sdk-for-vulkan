Welcome to the '|SDK_project|' documentation
============================================

The '|SDK_project|' is a collection of libraries and tools to assist with the
integration and deployment of ML use cases via the Vulkan速 API. The ML SDK for Vulkan速 makes use
of the new ML extensions for Vulkan速 which provide a hardware abstraction to enable
deployment of ML workloads that are both portable and accelerable. The extensions are:

- `VK_ARM_data_graph <https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/appendices/extensions.html#VK_ARM_data_graph>`_
- `VK_ARM_tensors <https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/appendices/extensions.html#VK_ARM_tensors>`_
- `SPV_ARM_graph <https://github.khronos.org/SPIRV-Registry/extensions/ARM/SPV_ARM_graph.html>`_
- `SPV_ARM_tensors <https://github.khronos.org/SPIRV-Registry/extensions/ARM/SPV_ARM_tensors.html>`_

The tight integration of ML workloads into the rendering pipeline enables graphics
use cases at improved levels of performance and efficiency and by leveraging the
`TOSA <https://www.mlplatform.org/tosa>`_ 1.x specification, you can expect consistent behavior
accross multiple vendor implementations.
